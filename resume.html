            <h3>Professional Ball Getter</h3>
            <p><b>Skills:</b> sleeping, begging for human food, BALL, and giving kisses.</p>

            <p><b>Experience:</b> I have experience at the vet (I don't like it there), at the groomer (they always change my smell), and in the car (I like going in the car!).</p>
            <p><b>Achievements:</b> Some things I get cookies for are sitting, speaking, giving high five, and even after I eat all my food. Dessert after dinner!</p>
